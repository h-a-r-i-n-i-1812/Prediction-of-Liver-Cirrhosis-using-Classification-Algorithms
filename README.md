# Liver Cirrhosis Prediction

🚀 This project aims to predict liver cirrhosis using machine learning classification algorithms. Liver cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by liver scarring, impaired liver function, and potentially life-threatening complications.

## Dataset

📊 The dataset used in this project contains various features related to liver health, such as age, bilirubin levels, cholesterol levels, albumin levels, etc. The target variable is the stage of liver cirrhosis.
- 📌 ID: Unique identifier for each patient.
- 📌 N_Days: Number of days the patient survived after diagnosis.
- 📌 Status: Indicates the survival status of the patient (e.g., alive, dead).
- 📌 Drug: Type of drug administered to the patient.
- 📌 Age: Age of the patient.
- 📌 Sex: Gender of the patient.
- 📌 Ascites: Presence of ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen).
- 📌 Hepatomegaly: Enlargement of the liver.
- 📌 Spiders: Presence of spider angiomas (skin lesions).
- 📌 Edema: Presence of edema (swelling due to fluid retention).
- 📌 Bilirubin: Level of bilirubin in the blood.
- 📌 Cholesterol: Level of cholesterol in the blood.
- 📌 Albumin: Level of albumin in the blood.
- 📌 Copper: Level of copper in the blood.
- 📌 Alk_Phos: Level of alkaline phosphatase in the blood.
- 📌 SGOT: Level of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase in the blood.
- 📌 Tryglicerides: Level of triglycerides in the blood.
- 📌 Platelets: Count of platelets in the blood.
- 📌 Prothrombin: Prothrombin time, a measure of blood clotting ability.
- 📌 Stage: Stage of liver disease.

## Algorithms

 We compare the performance of the following classification algorithms:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest

## Evaluation Metrics

📈 The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy: the proportion of correctly classified instances.
- Confusion Matrix: provides a breakdown of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
- Classification Report: includes precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

## Results

🎉 Here are the results of our comparison:

- SVM: 90%
- Logistic Regression: 89%
- KNN: 92%
- Random Forest:97%

## Conclusion

🔍 Based on our evaluation, Random Forest performed the best in terms of accuracy for liver cirrhosis prediction.
